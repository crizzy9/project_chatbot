How does Professional Direct Limited Advisory Support compare to Premier Advisory support?
Professional Direct (ProDirect) Advisory support provides you access to Azure Support guidance based on (1) publically available, best practices documentation regarding Microsoft Azure and (2) information from the Azure Forums.  ProDirect advisors offer you support based on their access to Microsoft documentation, to the Microsoft Azure Support Engineers, and also to the Microsoft Azure product group.  Best practices guidance may include, for example, ProDirect, however, is more limited than Premier Advisory Support.  ProDirect advisors do not provide detailed advisory assistance specific to an individual customer such as design, architecture, or code reviews; detailed instructions for application or configuration tuning (e.g., performance tuning); or the verification of specifications.  ProDirect does not provide onsite support or engage in implementation activities such as, but not limited to, coding or configuration for customer development or deployment on Microsoft Azure.
