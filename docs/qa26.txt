I’m running a non-Microsoft technology on Microsoft Azure or a custom application built using Open Source Software (OSS). Does my plan support it?
Microsoft offers customers the ability to run non-Microsoft technologies on the Microsoft Azure platform, including but not limited to Linux, Oracle, SAP, and IBM. For all scenarios that are eligible for support through an Azure Support plan, Microsoft Support will help in isolating the issue between the Microsoft Azure Service and your custom application. Full technical support will be provided if the issue is determined to be caused by a Microsoft Azure service or platform. Commercially reasonable support will be provided to all other scenarios. When an adequate solution to your issue is not achieved, you might be referred to other support channels that are available for the non-Microsoft software.
