How do I purchase Azure Support?
Azure Support plans may be purchased either online or through an Enterprise Agreement. The Developer, Standard, or Professional Direct Support plans are available online through the   page. You must be the Microsoft Azure account owner to purchase a support plan. If you purchase Microsoft Azure through an Enterprise Agreement (EA), you can add either a Standard or Professional Direct support plan to your Enterprise Agreement, by contacting your Large Account Reseller (LAR). Developer Support is not available through an Enterprise Agreement.
